                    <p>The January 2024 Niya Yoga Rishikesh Retreat was amazing. Our two week program was filled with
                        four daily yoga classes, with shared meals, with small and large ceremonies, with temple and
                        ashram explorations, with market shopping, and with so much more. There was great opportunity
                        for cultural exchange between teachers and students and for individual observation of this
                        wonderful small part of India. I would gratefully attend again.</p>

                    <p>Just returned from Niya Yoga retreat in Rishikesh India, what can I say, it superseeded all my
                        expectations, it was an amazing experience! The Niya team based in Rishikesh were outstanding
                        teachers with a wealth of experience and knowledge who gave specific daily classes in asana,
                        meditation and pranayama. The classes progressed over the 2 weeks with all teachers giving
                        individual attention to every student bringing them on a journey within their practice. These
                        classes were interspersed with fantastic excursions and really enjoyable activities where
                        teachers often joined in the fun letting us get to know each one of them on a personal basis. We
                        were looked after so well, always having the support of the team who also added a whole lot of
                        joy and fun to the entire experience. They were really amazing, so kind and helpful. Our
                        accommodation was very nice, the hotel staff were so accommodating and always tried their best
                        to make our stay enjoyable. The food was fabulous- we all enjoyed the Indian food (both in the
                        hotel and outside in cafes and restaurants) and came home addicted to Indian chai 😂. I love
                        yoga and this retreat has brought me to another of understanding as well as making new life long
                        friends. So well done Nayomi and the Niya team for providing a first class retreat! And thank
                        you for such a wonderful and truly memorable experience. ❤️</p>

                    <p> I had the pleasure and privilege of joining Nayomi and the Niya team in Rishikesh for their
                        retreat in January.
                        We enjoyed the warmest welcome on arrival and thereafter from all the beautiful people we met on
                        our travels.
                        We had a fantastic daily yoga, Pranayama and meditation programme catered for our level and
                        learned so much from very accomplished and wonderful teachers to take with us into our daily
                        practice.
                        We were extremely well looked after in all aspects of the holiday by the team who were available
                        to us at all times ensuring all our needs were met And that we were happy and comfortable . The
                        hotel was very well located within walking distance of beautiful walks and near the local
                        markets and all the lovely cafes and eateries we enjoyed. And the hotel food was delicious and
                        the staff were extremely attentive .
                        The team organised excursions and ceremonies , and they joined us to share their knowledge in
                        the local culture and history ,with trips to temples ,the mountains and the famous Ganges . We
                        had yoga on the beach and meditated amidst waterfalls . We enjoyed excellent cuisine and
                        shopping out and about .
                        All the extra touches such as the massage ,Henna tattoo session , Bollywood lessons, Kirtan and
                        cooking lessons added an extra fun vibe to our holiday.
                        I would highly recommend Niya’s yoga retreat where you meet the most wonderful team of people
                        and enjoy the most beautiful Indian cultural and yoga experience.
                        It far exceeded my expectations..
                        I’ve come away with an added appreciation for life, health and happiness.
                        And I will hopefully meet the Niya team again in the future.</p>

                    <p>The yoga retreat organized by Niya Yoga Studio was a transformative experience for me. Surrounded
                        by nature and guided by knowledgeable instructors, I was able to learn different yoga styles
                        with perfection.</p>
