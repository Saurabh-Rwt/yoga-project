                                <p>Whether you are a beginner or an experienced yoga practitioner who is looking to
                                    improve their practice, a yoga retreat like Niya Yoga Studio is the best place to
                                    practice your yoga and to deep dive into this ancient practice. Here you can start
                                    your journey from learning the basics to becoming an experienced doer.</p>

                                <p>Choosing a yoga style for you might be challenging, but you can make it easy by
                                    knowing your motivation to practice yoga. Ask yourself the question: Why do you want
                                    to practice yoga, and what is the reason behind it? Is it to be a yoga instructor or
                                    to relax your mind? This will help you choose the best form as per your goal.</p>
